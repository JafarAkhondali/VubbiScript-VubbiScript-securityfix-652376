# Build scripts

These build scripts will generate the "unitypackage" file and put it in the "../bin" folder.

To run the build scripts, execute build.ps1 in PowerShell.

Note: the build scripts depend on `C:\Python27\Python.exe`, `C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Unity.exe` (+ some libraries in that folder) and `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node`. All other dependencies should be downloaded automatically.
