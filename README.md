# Scratchity

> Scratchity is a block based programming environment (similar to Scratch) for Unity 3D.
> It is meant as a next step after mastering Scratch when learning to program. It should make it easier to start programming in Unity 3D. 

> It does not try to have blocks for all possible features of Unity 3D. Nor does it try to have the same blocks as Scratch (Unity 3D has different concepts). The idea is that this plugin eases the introduction to Unity 3D. 

> Once you mastered Scratchity and need more complex features than Scratchity supports, you can quit using Scratchity and seamlessly switch to programming in C#.

## How to get the code & try it out (in development mode)

1. Do a git clone
2. Clone the submodules

   ```
   git submodules init
   git submodules update
   ```

   (or have a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3796927/how-to-git-clone-including-submodules)
3. Open the Unity project located in src/unity-project

## Building Scratchity and making an "installer"

(coming soon)

## Current State

Work in progress.
