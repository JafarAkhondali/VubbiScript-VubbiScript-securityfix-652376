# Scratchity

> Scratchity is a block based programming environment (similar to Scratch) for Unity 3D.
> It is meant as a next step after mastering Scratch when learning to program. It should make it easier to start programming in Unity 3D. 

> It does not try to have blocks for all possible features of Unity 3D. Nor does it try to have the same blocks as Scratch (Unity 3D has different concepts). The idea is that this plugin eases the introduction to Unity 3D. Once you mastered Scratchity and need more blocks you can seamlessly switch to programming in C#.

## Current State

Not stable yet. Work in progress. (Not ready for use yet)

Interested people (for helping with development or testing/using the program) should send me a mail. My email can be found at my website http://jeroenp.awardspace.com/.
